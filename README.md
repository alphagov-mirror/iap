# IAP

A not-production-ready identity aware proxy written in Go

## Design

IAP consists of two components:

- IAP
- IAPSOCKS

Where IAP is a web proxy that uses Open ID Connect (OIDC) to authenticate and
authorize users to upstream services.

And IAPSOCKS is a SOCKS5 proxy that authenticates and authorizes users to
upstream services based on credentials generated by IAP.
